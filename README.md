# AWS Nitro util

# AWS Nitro utilities

This repo contains a Nix flake with some helpers to reproducibly build AWS Nitro Enclave image files.

You can think of it as an alternative to `nitro-cli build-enclave` for building EIFs. The idea is to:
- have  a more secure EIF-building process, by having the tool that builds them also be bit-by-bit reproducible, thus reducing the surface for supply-chain attacks as well as removing some implicit trust on AWS.
- remove the dependency on containers completely, while still allowing their use
- give users complete control over their enclave images, providing additional options like BYOK (Bring Your Own Kernel)
- easily build EIFs on systems other than Amazon Linux, including M1+ Macs (e.g, it's possible to build an x86_64 Linux EIF on an ARM Mac)

We recommend [this excellent blog post](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/02/16/a-few-notes-on-aws-nitro-enclaves-images-and-attestation) to learn more about the EIF Nitro image format in general.


The tradeoffs between using this repo and AWS' `nitro-cli` are:
| Feature | `nitro-cli build-enclave` | monzo/aws-nitro-util |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| EIF userspace input | Docker container | plain files, including nix packages and unpacked OCI images
| EIF bootstrap input | pre-compiled kernel binary provided by AWS | Bring Your Own Kernel (but you can still choose AWS' if you choose not to compile your own)
| dependencies | Docker, linuxkit fork, [aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-image-format](https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-image-format/) | Nix, [aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-image-format](https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-image-format/)
| Source-reproducible | no, uses pre-compiled blobs provided by AWS | yes, can be built entirely from source
| Bit-by-bit reproducible EIFs | no, EIFs are timestamped | yes, building the same EIF will result in the same SHA256
| cross-architecture EIFs | yes, if you provide a container for the right architecture | yes, if you provide binaries for the right architecture
| OS* | [Amazon Linux](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-cli-install.html) unless you [compile `nitro-cli` from source](https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-cli/tree/main/docs) for other Linux. No MacOS. | any Linux or MacOS with a Nix installation


(*): OS for building EIFs. Note that even if you make an EIF on a Mac, it can still only run on Linux.

## Examples

Flake quick start, to build an enclave with nixpkgs' `hello` :
```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    nitro-util.url = "github:/monzo/aws-nitro-util";
    nitro-util.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils, nitro-util, ... }:
    let system = x86_64-linux; 
        nitro = nitro-util.lib.${system};
        eifArch = "x86_64";
    in {
        packages.${system}.eif-hello-world = nitro.mkEif {
            # use AWS' nitro-cli kernel and kernelConfig
            inherit (nitro.blobs.${eifArch}) kernel kernelConfig;

            arch = eifArch;
            name = "eif-hello-world";
            ramdisks = [
                (lib.mkSysRamdisk { init = lib.blobs.${eifArch}.init; nsmKo = lib.blobs.${eifArch}.nsmKo; })
                (lib.mkUserRamdisk { entrypoint = "/bin/hello"; env = ""; rootfs = pkgs.legacyPackages.${system}.hello; })
            ];
        };
    };
}
```

## Design

monzo/aws-nitro-util is made up of a small CLI that wraps  [aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-image-format](https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-image-format/) (which allows building an EIF from a specific file structure) and of Nix utilities to reproducibly build the CLI and its inputs.

A typical EIF build would look like the following:
